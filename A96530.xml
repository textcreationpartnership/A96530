            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For Firſt it was by your command that this Sermon was compoſed of them, for the Pulpit. And then by your command it was, that this Sermon of them was thus diſpoſed into a Pamphlet. It troubled me very much to heare my ſelfe ſo entreated as I was, to Pen this Sermon for your peruſall; But it troubled me farre more to ſee my ſelfe enforced as I have beene, to requeſt it back againe to ſend it to the Preſse. You cannot but remember, that when you did ſo heartily deſire my Notes, I did as humbly as I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they might never be made publick. I onely thought upon the Pulpit in my ſtudying for them; And I thought but onely of your private peruſall in tranſcribing of them. I would they might have reſted in your hands perpetually. But they are even enforced thus to come abroad, and appeare in publick, and your Worſhip knows from whence the violence was offered to them.</p>

                  <p>If ever therefore Chriſtian Charity were a ſubject fit for every Pulpit, it is now: for now is almoſt every Subject out of Charity; yea almoſt quite out of Charity with the Pulpit.</p>

                  <p>Indeed the Pulpit ſhould never ceaſe to ſound of Charity to the people, when ever ſound Charity indeed is ceaſed amongſt the people.</p>
                  <p>The Anticellencies of ſome <hi>Gifted-men</hi> in <hi>Corinth</hi> did make them <hi>famous;</hi> their <hi>fame</hi> did make them <hi>proud;</hi> their <hi>pride</hi> did make them <hi>factious;</hi> and their <hi>factions</hi> made <hi>Confuſion.</hi>

                  <p>Had thoſe of <hi>Corinth</hi> coveted the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to make them humble, as impenſely, as they did ſome other <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> to make them admirable, their Church had been leſſe tranſient, but they much more tranſcendent.</p>

The very Heathen will riſe up in judgement with the men of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and condemne them; for many of them were very ready to forgive offences. The Time would faile mee to tell you the ſtories of <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> of <hi>Phocion,</hi> and of <hi>Socrates</hi> famed by <hi>Apollos Oracle</hi> for the wiſeſt man in the World, and of many others, that were eaſily intreated, yea without any intreaties, that were ready to paſſe by indignities. When <hi>Calvus</hi> the <hi>Orator,</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> the <hi>Poet,</hi> had inveighed bitterly againſt <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> hee freely forgave them once and againe. <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> are all renouned to Poſterity for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to forgive offences.

It does not as Authority does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Now whether it were Authority, rather then Charity, thus to charge this publike office of Preaching upon the weakeſt abilities to diſcharge it, ye may be Judges: For my part, I will not, may not judge, what it was that did firſt charge that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority where it is, ſo full of other Charges. But for this, which concernes my charge, I may ſay, that it was for a man to<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12. Luke 6. 31.</note> doe as he was done to, not as a man would have been done to. But now this Charge is even done, and that with Charity. There are but ſome few others, to whom I muſt leave this Exhortation, and ſo diſcharge my ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Let no Man therefore either thinke, or ſay that ſufferings are the onely Salaries, or the ſole rewards that our Saviour Chriſt vouchſafeth to beſtow upon his Souldiers, and upon his Servants: For never did any Souldier beare armes under the commands of a more Noble Captaine, or more excellent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; Nor can any man ſerve a better or more generous Maſter.</p>

                  <p>Here we beginne to die ſo ſoone as we begin to live; All here are borne to die, and many are but borne, and die.</p>
                  <q>Naſcentes morimur, finiſque ab origine pendet;</q>
                  <p>Being born we die, as ſaith <hi>Manilius,</hi> &amp; the laſt of our days does pend upon the firſt. Our Death does hang about us from our Birth. We all are bound towards the Womb of ourgreat grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother the Earth, ſo ſoone as wee be looſed from our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wombe. Hee that is borne to day is borne to die, and is not ſure to live an other day: But in the glorious preſence of God, there is no dying, they that are there are ſure to live for ever, free from the ſting of Death, and from the ſtroke; free from all tendencies unto Death, and from all feares of dying. When the Naturall Body of a Saint comes there, it does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>spirituall Body;</hi> It is there ſpiritualized in the manner of ſubſiſtence, though not in the Nature of the ſubſtance. It is ſtill a Body, though it be ſpirituall, and it is ſaid to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> becauſe it there lives the life of a ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, like a ſpirit, there it liveth without any hunger, without any thirſt, without feeling pinching cold, or parching heat. It needs no meate, it needs no drinke, it needs no ſummers ſtuffe, nor winters cloath.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it liveth like a ſpirit there, free from ſickneſſe, free from Aches, free from all ſorts of Diſeaſes; It cannot bee diſtempered into a Fever, nor diſſolved into a Flux, nor corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Ulcers.</p>

Not one can there be found to hate us, or to be hated by us.</p>
                  <p>The Favorites in that Court are never divided into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Nor are there any factious Subjects in that whole Kingdome. There are no Envyings, no Emulations, they that are beſt beloved by the King of Glory, are beloved beſt by all the Court, and all the Kingdome too. The greater love and favour that any one receiveth from that King, the greater is the outward joy, and inward gladneſſe of all the fellow Courtiers, and fellow-Subjects. The Joy and Happineſſe of any one in that preſence is a Joy and Happineſſe to every one.

                  <p>When but one penitent Sinner enters the Externall Court of Heaven, the Church Militant, the glorious Saints and Angels doe rejoyce in Heaven for it; <hi>There is joy in Heaven,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ever one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> Luke 15. 7.

                  <p>There are none that are not willing to let that Ocean of Honour and Glory flow which way it pleaſeth, and how farre it pleaſeth; There are none that ſeeke to obſtruct any ſtreames of Honour derived from that Fountaine.

And therefore nothing can cauſe true joy in the ſoule, or cauſe the joy of the ſoule to be full, but the infinite goodneſſe of Gods glorious preſence. There

Till all our ſoules enjoy that infinite goodneſſe of Gods glorious preſence, which is all in all, or all in every one, and yet but one in all, they will alwayes be coveting thoſe good things which others have, and they have not, rather then Contenting of themſelves with thoſe good things they have, and others have not. But when they ſhall enjoy that bliſſefull preſence, they ſhall not wiſh for any thing elſe. That preſence is to every ſoule that does enjoy it, what ever good it does deſire to<note place="margin">Erit omne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; non erit aliquod malum: erit quicquid voles, non erit quicquid-noles. <hi>S.

                  <p>Indeed the fullneſſe of any evill is an evill fullneſſe, for it ever cauſeth wearineſſe, and bringeth wiſhings of exchanges: But the fullneſſe of joy in the preſence of God, does never create any wearineſſe, nor any beginnings of diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

The Inches of Dayes are the fitteſt meaſures for the Hand-breadth of humane life. The length of<note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note> humane life is <hi>but one ſpan,</hi> and every day does ſhorten that little length at leaſt an Inch. <hi>Jacobs</hi> life was but of Dayes, and the Dayes of <hi>Jacobs</hi> life were in all but few; And all thoſe few Dayes of <hi>Jacobs</hi> life were evill, as he ſaid himſelfe, few and evill have<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> they beene. And whoſe life may not be meaſured by dayes as well as <hi>Jacobs?</hi> And whoſe dayes of life are not few, as few as <hi>Jacobs?</hi> Whoſe life of Dayes is not ſhort, as ſhort as his? And whoſe few Dayes of life are not all evill, as evill as <hi>Jacobs?</hi> Who can looke upon them and not ſay truly, <hi>few and evill have thy been?</hi> But are all our dayes evill? Why then doe we all complaine, that they are few? Are not a few evill Dayes enough? Will any wiſe man wiſh for many evill Dayes? And againe, are all our evill Dayes but few? why doe we then complaine, that they are evill? Who may not beare with a few evill Dayes, that expects an Eternity of good Dayes, when theſe few evill Dayes are ended?</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place therefore, if we doe beleeve the Truth in the words of the Text, if we be perſwaded, that there is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy in the preſence of God, and pleaſure at his right hand for evermore, then let us never reckon any ſufferings to be too many, or too great, or too long to be endured, for the obtaining of thoſe joyes and pleaſures that ſhall endure for ever. But let us reckon with <hi>S. Paul, that the ſufferings of this</hi>

                     <hi>affliction laſting but a moment, ſhall worke for us a farre more exceeding, and eternall weight of glory.</hi> The Lord does make the bitternes of this life of ſorrowes to ſeeme the more imbittered to his ſervants, that the ſweetneſs of the life of joyes may ſeeme the ſweeter to them when they come to the enjoyment of it.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151452:41"/> Yet that the bittereſt ſorrowes of this life may be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, the ſweeteſt joyes of life are promiſed to them that in their ſorrowes wait for joyes with patience. And to perſwade to patience in the midſt of ſorrowes, we muſt obſerve them to be common. What Militant Saint did ever <hi>beare the Enſigne</hi> of a Mortall life, without ſome <hi>Croſſe,</hi> or <hi>Croſſelet</hi> in it? Who could ever <hi>blazon the Eſcocheon</hi> of his Militancy, or Mortality, and not finde the <hi>Field of his life to be charged</hi> with <hi>Croſſes Gules,</hi> or <hi>Croſſes Sable?</hi> The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> could not; nor could the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> And who indeed can wiſh for the heaven of happineſſe, or the happineſſe of heaven here, where the King of heaven went through an hell of miſeries?

                     </gap>, Many inſtructions are taught by afflictions; God ſendeth Croſſes in ſtead of Bleſſings unto thoſe he hateth, but he often bleſſeth thoſe with croſſes which he loveth. <hi>It is well for them</hi>

                     <hi>that they are afflicted.</hi> It is very true that <hi>Oppreſſion makes the wiſe man mad;</hi> for ſo ſayes the wiſe man himſelfe in his Booke of the Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 7. And it is as true if we Preach it, that oppreſſion makes ſome madd men wiſe. But who is willing to be Schooled by ſo curſt a Pedagoge? But <hi>volenter nolenter,</hi> whether men will or no it muſt ſometimes be ſo, and better ſo then worſe for ever. Too much it is for one man to enjoy two Heavens; And as great pitty it is that any one ſhould endure two Hells. And therefore I may truly ſay, that God of his goodneſſe, and his wiſdome, hath appointed one of each for every man. There is not onely an Heaven or an Hell for any one, but an Heaven and an Hell for every one. This preſent world is both, but unto ſeverall Men; It is the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Heaven, but Hell it is unto the Saints on Earth. The ſinfull worldling takes his pleaſure here, he hath all his happineſſe here that he is ever like to have; here are all his joyes, and all his hopes of joy; He wiſhes for no other Heaven; he lookes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151452:42"/> not after any other. He thinketh not of that to be enjoyed hereafter. Here would he live for ever if he might; But alas! It may not be. This world muſt not laſt alwayes; and though it might, yet might not his life in it; his life is but of few dayes, It ſoone muſt have an end. What wiſe man then would wiſh to live his beſt life firſt, ſeeing that it muſt ſo ſoone be loſt? Who would wiſh to have his heaven here, where he can ſtay but a few dayes? Yea where he cannot aſſure himſelfe to ſtay one day, or houre?</p>
                  <p>Againe this preſent world is a kind of Hell to others, or in ſtead of Hell unto them; It is a Place of Trouble, a Place of Suffering. But their ſtay here is ſhort. Now who would not rather endure the Hell of a few dayes miſeries here, and enjoy the Heaven of Eternall happineſſe hereafter, then enjoy the Heaven of a few dayes pleaſure here, and endure the Eternall miſeries of Hell hereafter? Temporall Pleaſures are dearly bought with the loſſe of Eternall; And temporall ſufferings are well requited with eternall Pleaſures. That is a miſerable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe that muſt end in ſuch miſeries as muſt never end; And thoſe are happie miſeries that ſhall ſoone end in endleſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. This life is but a journey towards Death, and but a ſhort one; And Death is yet a ſhorter paſſage to a longer, and a better life. Indeed no Mortall Pilgrim can be wearie of the longeſt journey of life, if by the way he does but well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the endleſſe joys that he ſhall enjoy at his journeys end. But yet the ſhorter that his journey be, the ſooner ſhall he be at home poſſeſſed of thoſe joyes. And who would wiſh a long and tedious journey to himſelfe to keepe him long from the enjoyment of them?</p>
                  <p>That life of joyes is worth the wiſhing, that ſhall never have an End; And that End of life is full as worthy of our wiſhes, that ſhall begin the Joyes of that endleſſe life. And that end<note place="margin">Theophra.</note> muſt be ere long; for <hi>Vita brevis,</hi> life is ſhort. <hi>Man that is borne of a woman is but of a few dayes, and full of trouble,</hi> ſaith <hi>holy Job.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 14. 1.</note> He is of few dayes, that he may not live too long in trouble; And his dayes are full of trouble, that he may not long for more of them then a few. Mans dayes are full of trouble, that a few may ſerve his turne and make him weary of them; And
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151452:42"/> his dayes of trouble are but few, that he may not be too much wearied with them. It is mans great Miſery, that his few dayes are full of trouble; And it is Gods great Mercy, that mans dayes of trouble are but few: for if the Dayes of Mans life be full of trouble, it is well for Man, that his life of trouble is not full of Dayes. It is ill for Man that the troubles of his few dayes are ſo many; And it is well for Man that his dayes of trouble are ſo few. The few dayes of Mans life are full of trouble, that Man may dayly be minded of his duty in ſeeking<note place="margin">

                  <p>Then let the Miſeries which accompany Mortality weane us from all fondneſſe towards this life preſent; And let the felicity of life eternall win us to long after that. The thoughts of the <hi>Elyſian happineſſe</hi> did ſo encourage a <hi>poore Grecian,</hi> a <hi>meere Pagan,</hi> at the inſtant of his death, that he rejoyced much to think of going to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and other learned Philoſophers; to <hi>Olympus,</hi> and other skilfull Muſicians; to <hi>Hecataeus,</hi> and other<note place="margin">Hecataeus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſius Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus celeberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.

Alas! theſe Worldly riches, in compare with thoſe of Heaven (as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us) are altogether vain, yea vanity it ſelf, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks them in the ſame ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But here let us advance the Suppoſition one ſtep higher: Let us ſuppoſe the Riches of the World to be neither vanity nor vain, but to have reality and worth in them, yet ſtill the Queſtion may be asked, <hi>What is a man profited?</hi> For what profit can it be to a man to gain ſuch things, as he may not think his own when he has gained them, nor uſe them as his own? They that get theſe Worldly Riches by ungodly means, are by thoſe means indebted to the <hi>God of this World</hi> for them: And he will be paid by all his Debtors;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> They may all look to be arreſted at his Suit, and caſt into the priſon of Hell, but may not look to get out thence. <hi>untill they have paid the uttermoſt farthing.</hi> And as for ſuch as uſe the lawfulleſt means to get them, they may not uſe them as they liſt or will themſelves when they have got them: For why, they are but Servants, in receiving of them; but Truſtees, in keeping of them; and but as meer Stewards they muſt be, in accounting for them. Now it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in Stewards <hi>to be found faithfull;</hi> Faithfull in all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 2.</note> faithfull in all Disburſements, faithfull in all Intruſtments.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf was the Maker of all this World. And he himſelf is the Maſter of it. He is the Author of all good in the World. And he is the Owner of all the goods of all the World. Man muſt ever therefore have reſpect to him, and to his pleaſure, in the uſing of his goods. There muſt at laſt be a generall Audit, and man muſt reckon for all; And woe unto him, if he makes not an even Reckoning. An even Reckoning is hard to be made, though never ſo ſmall, but the greateſt Reckonings are hardeſt to be made even. There is no <hi>Euge</hi> to be expected from the Maſter, without an even Reckoning from the Servant: Nor can the Servant make his Reckoning even then, unleſſe he be now <hi>fidelis in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151452:53"/> minimis,</hi> faithful in the ſmalleſt driblets, faithfull to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing, careful not to waſte the very minutes of his Maſters goods, by miſpending of them. He is ſaid to waſte his Maſters goods, that does miſpend thoſe goods by rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous courſes, which are entruſted in his hands. And for his waſting of them ſo, he is ſoon to be diſcarded from all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtments by his Maſter: <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> ſaith his Maſter to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 1. Come, <hi>give an account of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer ſteward. Durus eſt hic ſermo:</hi> This is an hard ſaying: But it it ſaid, and it muſt be ſo; There muſt an Account be given. And now doth not this great Rich Worldling begin to wiſh that he had ever been a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> rather then a <hi>Dives?</hi> That he had never<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19, &amp;c.</note> been entruſted with ſo much of this Worlds goods, that ſo he might not now have had ſo much to reckon for? But <hi>to whom much is given, of him there is much to be required.</hi> He<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 48.</note> muſt now anſwer for all. He had a great Truſt committed to him, and now he diſtruſts his Reckoning the more. The Reckoning is ſo great that he is to make, that he makes no reckoning to ſave himſelf when he hath made it. By the<note place="margin">

And therefore what he is, <hi>Soul and Body,</hi> muſt be ſold, that payment may be made. Now tell me, where is his profit? He willingly loſt that other, that better World, for this; and now hath loſt both this, and himſelf, with that other.</p>
                  <p>But let us put the Suppoſition one ſtep higher: Let us ſuppoſe a man to gain the World, and to uſe it as he ought. Yet ſtill the Queſtion may be asked,</p>
                  <q>What is a man profited?</q>
                  <p>For why, ſtill he cannot keep it; He muſt be taken from<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> that by death, if that be not taken from him before. <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all men once to die.</hi> And there is no man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either how he ſhall die, or where he ſhall die, or when

                  <p>Fourthly, and laſt, Damnation is like to Death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Horrour. Death is called the King of feares, the moſt terrible of terribles. Nature abhorreth nothing more then Death, there is nothing that is known to Man more terrible; and therefore is Damnation called Death. Indeed Damnation is beyond expreſſion terrible, yea beyond all apprehenſion; we want words to expreſſe it by, we want things more hideous to reſemble it unto. We miſ-call it Death, but it is not Death indeed. The Damned may wiſh for Death, but they muſt not dye. The Damned ſouls are all immortal, they are ſent to Hell to live in miſery, yea to live in miſery for ever, yea for ever and for ever. The expreſſion is as uſeful, as it is uſual: Mark it well, <hi>for ever and for ever.</hi> That which is but once for ever, can never have an end. But the living, and laſting Miſeries of Hell are ſaid to be for ever, and for ever, to make us the more ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them. This Duplication intimateth thus much to us, that when the poore damned ſoule hath paſſed a thouſand years, and ten thouſands more, and as many thouſands more as the nimbleſt imagination can conceive of, and more Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Ages more then the beſt <hi>Arithmetician</hi> can ever mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, yet then he ſhall be as if he were newly to begin, he hath ſtill and ſtill another <hi>for ever</hi> to endure miſeries. This it is that does ſo aggravate the Miſery of Man by his Worldly Merchandize. If he muſt loſe his Soul, for his gaining of the World, his loſſe is infinite, becauſe the Damnation of his Soul is endleſſe. It is for ever and ever.

                  <p>A fourth Reaſon to raiſe the eſtimate of the Soul, may be taken from the Reaſon in it.

                     </note> Man, to prize his Soul above the World, may be taken from the conſideration of that price which our Saviour paid for the redemption of it. And was it not very conſiderable, think you, that the Sonne of God, the welbeloved Sonne of God, the onely begotten Sonne of God, equal to the Father in goodneſſe, and power, and glory, and majeſty, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo low as to become a Man, a Man of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the very ſcorn and deriſion of men, and the very <hi>Outcaſt of the people?</hi> That he ſhould take upon him <hi>the forme of a Servant,</hi> and vouchſafe to be a Servant of ſervants; To be mocked of many, to be hated of moſt, to be forſaken of all at laſt? Yea more, that he ſhould aſſelf the blame, and ſhame, and ſufferings of all the ſinnes of man; Of man that was his enemy, of man that hated him? That he ſhould die for man; and die the worſt of deaths too, the death of the Croſſe, a painful death, a ſhameful death, an hateful death, a curſed death? And more yet; That he ſhould ſuffer as many Torments of Hell it ſelf, as might ſave man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tormented for ever? Can we think that he, the Sonne of God, begotten of the Father of Wiſdome, yea begotten <hi>of the Wiſdome of the Father,</hi> ſhould dote on Man to very folly, and do and ſuffer this, even all this, for a toy, for a trifle, for a thing of nothing? Surely he did highly prize
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:151452:58"/> the Soul of man, or he would never have done and ſuffered ſo much to redeem it. Too many there be indeed, that make too little reckoning of their Soules: For, all they do ſo, that adventure the loſing of them, for the gaining of the World. Indeed if man had many Soules, the loſſe of one were not ſo much, as it is now that he hath but one. The loſſe of one is the loſſe of all, of himſelf and all.</p>
                  <p>And that is the ſecond Circumſtance concerning this Commodity Exported, to be conſidered; <hi>The Number or Quantity:</hi> His <hi>one Soul,</hi> in the ſingular number. When a cunning Merchant hath but a ſmall quantity of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commodity, he knows then what he hath to doe, he makes his price accordingly, or rather he knows not what price to make of it, he thinks he can never ask enough, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if theſe five Circumſtances be coincident with the ſmalneſſe of the Quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> if it be ſuch a kind of Commodity, as that he may be ſure he can get no more of the ſame kind, if he parts with that he hath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> if it be ſuch a Commodity as he cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, if he deſires to have a being; ſuch a Commodity as he can neither trade for the World, nor ſubſiſt in the World without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if it be a Commodity received from a Friend, and<note place="margin">Keep thy ſoule diligently, <hi>Deut. 4. 9.</hi>
                     </note> ſuch a Friend as he ought to love above the World, and that Friend gave it to him to the end that he might keep it for his own endleſſe good, and for his ſake that gave it to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if it be ſuch a Commodity as doth exceed all<note place="margin">For it coſt more to redeem their ſoules; ſo that he muſt let that alone for ever. <hi>Pſal. 49. 8. What ſhall he give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere oportet de anima per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita. <hi>Janſen.</hi>
                     </note> prices that can be given by this World for it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> if it be a Commodity that cannot be regained by any man that hath parted with it, although he would part with all back again that he took for it, and give even all that he had before to boot.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Circumſtances do concurre with the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the Soul. For, 1. A man can never get another Soul, when his own is loſt. 2. A man cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Soul, he could not be a Man but for his Soul, it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:151452:58"/> Soul that makes him ſo. 3. It was the Lord himſelf that gave his Soul unto him, and for his ſake he ought to keep it; and he gave it him to keep, untill that he ſhould come and take it to himſelf again. 4. It is of worth above the World. And laſtly, nothing in the World can ever redeem it, if it be loſt or laid to pawn. The loſſe muſt needs be great: And how great ſoever it be, that man that hath loſt it muſt beare all the loſſe; no man can be partner with him, becauſe it was <hi>his own ſoul,</hi> and onely his.</p>
                  <p>That's the third Circumſtance to be conſidered, and it is very conſiderable; It is <hi>his own Soul.</hi> Others can have no ſhare with him in the ſubſtance of this Commodity thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and therefore can they not be ſharers with him in his loſſe of it. Others may have their hands in the loſſe of this Soul, and ſo may be puniſhed with the loſſe of their own for it, yet will their loſſes no way leſſen his. His ſoul was all his own before he parted with it, and all the loſſe muſt be his own for parting from it. A great loſſe it muſt needs be unto him: It is the loſſe of his greateſt good, and with that the loſſe of all his goods. Yet for the gaining of wordly goods, too many adventure the loſſe of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Some Merchants have adventured much, and have gained more; they have adventured with their goods, and have ſaved themſelves: But others have loſt both their goods and themſelves by the like adventures. Some men have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured far for the gaining of the World, and have come home again to themſelves without loſing their Souls: But others have loſt them by adventuring of them. Some men loſe their Souls by adventuring of them: Some others ſell them, and ſo loſe them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we are fallen upon the third particular, the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe it ſelf,</hi> or the Negotiating of the Trade. And in this negotiating of the Trade, there are both gaining &amp; loſing: Gaining of the World, and loſing of the Soul. The gaines are great; <hi>gain the whole World:</hi> But the loſſe is greater; and <hi>loſe his own Soul.</hi> He that ſells his Soul for the whole World, makes but an ill bargain for himſelf: He is a loſer by the bargain, and ſuch a loſer, that his very ſoul may be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151452:59"/> ſaid to be loſt though he ſells it, becauſe he ſells it ſo much under foot. There are two Wayes to loſe the Soule by ſelling of it.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Men may be ſaid to ſell and loſe their ſouls by Whole-ſale, when they take <hi>ſome great reward of iniquity for them,</hi> and ſo Ioſe them all at once. And they may be ſaid to ſell them by Retaile, when they forfeit and loſe them by little and little. There are <hi>Minuta peccata,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> peccadillio's, little<note place="margin">S. August. de de Cevit. Dei. l. 2. cap. 32.</note> ſinnes. And there are <hi>Peccata conſcientiam vaſtantia,</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-waſting ſinnes, great offences. The Soule may be loſt by one of theſe, or it may be loſt by a multitude of thoſe. It is traded away by Whole-ſale, when it is loſt for one grand offence; And it is traded away by Retaile, when it is loſt for many minute offences. St <hi>Bernard</hi> calls theſe <hi>Venia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S.

St <hi>Auſtine</hi> compares theſe ſmaller ſinnes to the graines of Sand, and to the ſmalleſt drops of Water. The graines of Sand are very ſmall, yet if many of them be put together into a Bag, or Sack, and laid upon the head, or ſhoulders of a man, they will preſſe him down: And the drops of Raine are little by themſelves, yet when many meet together they may cauſe an inundation. Many ſmall ſinnes may be as heavy as one great ſinne, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Auguſt. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. 108. ad Seleuſian.</note> And he fitly reſembles the loſſe of a Soule to the loſſe of a Merchants ſhip upon the Sea; Sometimes a Ship is loſt by one great Wave that overwhelmes it, and ſinks it right downe; and ſometimes a Ship is loſt by the Water that leaks in by ſome breach or breaches in the ſides or bottome. So ſome mens ſoules are loſt by the ſinnes that ſue in through their leaking ſenſes; and ſometimes they are loſt by ſome great ſinne that ſwells above them, and ſinks them right downe to the very bottome of perdition; ſuch was that grand Rebellion of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and<note place="margin">Num. 16. 1, 2. 4. 31, 32, 33.</note> their <hi>factious Complices</hi> that roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaren</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:151452:59"/> to pull them downe. It was ſo heynous and ſo heavy a ſinne, that it ſunk them all to the pit of deſtruction, the very Earth was not able to bear them with that ſinne upon them. Some other trifled away theirs ſoules by little and little: But theſe traded theirs away by whole-ſale. But which way ſo ever they be ſold, they are but loſt. And in both theſe wayes of ſelling them there are two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, the making of the Bargaine.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, the performing of the Bargaine.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the making of it. And it may be made two wayes: Explicitely, or Implicitely; that is Formally, or by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Explicitely, or Formally, when both parties doe capitulate the Conditions, and agree upon the Termes. Thus Witches, and Wizards, and all Confederates with the Devil, are ſaid to ſell their ſoules unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Implicitely, or by conſequence: and this is when the Devil, or his Factors come into the Mart of this World, and fall to chaffering for Mens Soules by cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and bidding like Chapmen for them. The Devil comes to the Covetous man, and asketh him the price of his Soule; He comes to the Voluptuous man, and asketh him the price of his; And he comes to the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man, and asketh him the price of his. The price of the Covetous mans is Wealth; the price of the Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans is Pleaſure; and the price of the Ambitious mans is Honour. The Devil knows their ſeveral prizes, but knows not how to pay them downe: Yet like himſelfe he offers all they ask, and promiſeth in time to pay them all.<note place="margin">Matth. 4 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Haec omnia vobis dabo,</hi> all theſe things will I give unto you. And then for Earneſt, or in part of payment he puts a penny or a Teſton of unlawful gains into the hands of the Covetous man to conclude the Bargaine with him: He procures an opportunity of unlawful Pleaſure accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Voluptuous mans deſire, to conclude the Bargain with him: And by a ſmall Bribe he ſets the Ambitious man upon the firſt ſtep to preferment, to conclude with him.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151452:60"/> Theſe men cannot be ignorant of the Devils aims, they muſt needs know, that what he offers, is but in earneſt or in part of payment for their ſouls; yet they take his offers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are taken with his temptations: and what call you this, but a <hi>ſtriking up of the bargaine?</hi> Now the bargain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, the performance is expected.

                  <p>Yet for the <hi>Ballancing of the Trade,</hi> let me make a tendry to you of three or four Conſiderables.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, That the gaining of the whole World can never make the Gainer of it happy: But ſo will his ſaving of his own Soule.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, That a man muſt loſe the World, or leave it before he can be happy; but if his Soule be loſt, when it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151452:61"/> muſt leave him he can never be happy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, That the Soul is infinite in duration, and the World but finite. This but temporal; but that eternal, <hi>àparte poſt,</hi> as ſome diſtinguiſh. The one a matchleſſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the other a worthleſſe trifle in compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Now ballance theſe Conſiderables: What profit is it for a man to gain that, which can never make him happy, and loſe that for it, which would make him ſo for ever, if he did not loſe it? Or, what profit is it for a man to gaine that, which he muſt loſe again before he can be happy; and for his gaining of it, muſt loſe that which can no more be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor happines without it? Or, what profit can it be to gain that which is but finite, and loſe that which is infinite? <hi>Inter finitum, &amp; infinitum nulla datur proportio.</hi> There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between a thing that is finite, and a thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo then, that the whole World is not to be valued with one Soule? What folly then doe thoſe men ſhew to the world, that adventure the loſſe of their Soules for the very Attoms of the world, or the ſmalleſt gains that can be in the World? for an Inch in an Ell, for an Ounce in a Pound?

                  <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought (as <hi>Cicero</hi> telleth us) that all ſinnes are equal.

It hath been the judgment of many Orthodox Divines, that <hi>the Authors and the Abettors of the Arrian Hereſies</hi> had their Torments in Hell increaſed daily, as the number of Soules increaſed which were daily loſt by following of their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. Yet for a little applauſe amongſt ſome people, and for ſome ſmall Benevolence from them, the old Hereſies are unraked out of their aſhes, and new ones are blown up daily into blazing-flames, to the great diſturbance of <hi>Iſraels peace,</hi> and to the deſtruction of <hi>Sions proſperity.</hi> The Pulpits are prophaned, and the Preſſes are peſtered, and Myriads of Souls are ſeduced with the daring fancies of deſperate Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioniſts. For ſmall gains, ſome have written, and others have printed, and divers have vended dangerous Pamphlets, to corrupt mens judgments, and poyſon their affections, and undo their ſoules.

                  <p>It was a pious Reſolve in an Engliſh Gentleman, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Pen-man, neither to write, nor yet to read any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Paſquils.

                  <p>In the third place: Is it ſo, that <hi>our Saviour Chriſt the chief Paſtor and Biſhop of Souls,</hi> hath ſuch an eſtimate of Souls, that he deems one Soul worth more then all the World?

                  <list>
                     <item>1. An Exhortation.</item>
                     <item>2. An Expoſtulation.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The <hi>Exhortation</hi> is very paſſionate; The <hi>Expoſtulation</hi> very compaſſionate. The firſt in theſe words; <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a a new heart and a new ſpirit.</hi> The ſecond in theſe words; <hi>For why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> The firſt is moving, but the ſecond urging. <hi>Expoſtulatio pungit:</hi> A zealous Exppoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth infuſe the ſpirit of Compunction: it hath the quickeſt touch of any kind of ſpeech, it often toucheth to the quick. And God himſelf doth here expoſtulate the cauſe with dying Sinners, to make them ſenſible of their dangers, and to quicken them in their ſeeking of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Firſt he exhorts them to forſake their ſinnes, to ſave their ſoules. And then (ſeeing his Exhortation to work but little upon them, though it were pathetical and parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical) He falls to expoſtulate the reaſon with them: <hi>For why will ye die?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; If ye will but caſt away your ſinnes from you, ye ſhall not be caſt away for your ſinnes: But if ye will not, ye muſt: If ye will not leave them whileſt ye live, ye muſt die for them, whether ye will or no, and they muſt leave you, when ye die. <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> Why will ye? As much as to ſay; I muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reaſon, or ask the cauſe of you, in whom the<note place="margin">Provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands, and I will doe you no hurt. <hi>Jer. 25. 6.</hi>
                     </note> cauſe of dying is. Ye die, becauſe ye will die. <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> As much as to ſay, I would not have you die; it is not meerly from my will that ye die, but from your own. Doe not ſay then, that ye muſt needs die, becauſe I will have ye die; and that I will have ye die, becauſe I will. I have no
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151452:69"/> ſuch will: I would have you live; and therefore have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted you, and intreated you again and again to turn from your evil wayes, <hi>the wayes of ſinne,</hi> which are <hi>the wayes of death.</hi> And I have promiſed to you, that if ye will repent, <hi>iniquity</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall not be your ruine.</hi> And my meaning is very ſincere and real: I will be as good as my promiſe, if ye will be but as good as I deſire you. And becauſe I ſee mine <hi>Exhortation</hi> to be neglected of you, therfore do I come thus home unto you with an <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> to make you ſenſible of your fault, and folly, and to make you ſee, that the cauſe of death is in your ſelves, in your own wills, or rather in your <hi>wilfulneſſe.</hi> Ye will die. <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> Ye will do that for which ye muſt die: Ye will needs ſinne, to die for it: Ye will not avoid it, by reſiſting the Temptation; nor make it void, by repenting of it; and therefore ye muſt die for it, For <hi>the wages of ſinne is death.</hi> I muſt needs ſay unto you, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> Why will ye not return, and live? Why will ye not be perſwaded? why not intreated? why not commanded? Why, can no means, no mercies, no promiſes, no threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings prevail with you? Will ye ſinne wilfully? will ye die ſinfully? And yet will ye ſay, that it is <hi>my will</hi> that ye ſhould ſo doe, and ſo die? Ye do that which is quite againſt my mind, againſt my Word, which is my will. If ye die then, thank your ſelves for all your ſufferings, or rather blame your ſelves for all your ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Let this then ſerve as a <hi>Caveat</hi> to every Sinner, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him to take good heed that he doth not <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi> and falſely with the impulſive and originall cauſe of his eternal death. <hi>Nefas eſt Deo aſcribere cauſas peccatorum, &amp; ruinarum omnium,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtine.</hi> It is a funerious crime<note place="margin">S.

When our repenting of our ſinnes hath procured his love to pardon them, and his pardoning of our ſinnes hath perſwaded us to love him, then our love unto him muſt needs provoke us to abhorre even all our ſinnes, which provoked him to abhorre us; and to ſet our hatred moſt againſt thoſe <hi>Delilahs</hi> or delightful ſinnes, on which we once moſt ſet our hearts. Our Hearts are moſt of<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 26.</note> all deſired of God; And God (who is a (<hi>jealous God</hi> in this particular) is moſt jealous of thoſe ſins which have been our <hi>Darlings;</hi> for thoſe are moſt likely to ſteale away our hearts and turn away our loves from him.

And therefore we, to atteſt the truth of our love to him, muſt from our very Hearts deteſt thoſe ſinnes, and ſcorn to entertain them as beloved Suiters. Yea, we muſt even hate them with <hi>a perfect batred,</hi> or we cannot love God with entire love: And unleſs we love him, we cannot hope for his love towards us: And

But believe it upon a plain demonſtration, A great Sinner can never be a good Subject: His ſinnes are ever doing of more evil in a Kingdom, then he himſelf is able to do good: Whileſt the Sinner himſelf may be fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, his ſinnes are fighting againſt him and that. When a Kingdome quarrels with it ſelf, it is a ſigne that God hath a quarrel with it.

The ſinnes of each Party do take part with the other Party againſt the Sinners and their Parties. Yea indeed there would be no ſuch Parties, nor any need of ſuch parts-taking, but for the ſinnes of both Parties. O that every Party and every perſon would look upon their own ſinnes as the moſt <hi>malignant party,</hi> and as the worſt of enemies. O that every man would take ſome ſpeedy courſe to ſecure himſelf and all Parties, by ſeeking out of thoſe moſt <hi>dangerous Malignants</hi> that are in his own boſome, and bringing them to their tryals before the <hi>Bars of Self-examination,</hi> and Self-Conviction, and Self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation! That every man would turn out his own ſinnes, and turn them off, and return to the God of peace and mercy, that God might turn away <hi>his fierce anger</hi> from us all, and turn his diſpleaſure into love, and his controverſie with this Nation into a National peace. And this he might be perſwaded to do for us, cou'd we be perſwaded by him to turn from all our ſinnes, and return unto him. <hi>Wherefore turn your ſelves.</hi>

The ſooner men be good, the eaſier it is unto them to grow better. And the later they amend, the harder it is unto them to grow better, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue good. At this time there are many, who might by this time have been better then they are, had they been good but ſooner then they were: And would by this time have been worſe then ever they were, had they not grown better then they were untill this time.

                  <p>He that is unfit to repent to day, will be more unfit to morrow, for he will have more ſinnes to repent of, and will be hardened more in his ſinnes: He will have a Day more to repent of, and a Day leſſe to repent in.

Often reckoning doth make long friends: And eaſie reckonings are made by often reckoning. So it happens between man and man: And ſo it happens alſo between God and man. But many deale with God, as ſome evill Debtors deale with their Creditors; they ſtudy much how to get into debt, but not at all how to get out: They take great care to be truſted; but little care to pay. Whereas their firſt care ſhould be to run as little as may be into Gods Debt, by ſcoring up of Sins: And their next care ſhould be to get out of Debt as ſoon as may be. It is the height of impiety, to be hardened with impenitency. To commit ſin is to diſpleaſe God; but to continue in ſin, is to deſpiſe him, when he is diſpleaſed, or to ſleight his diſpleaſure. And to go on in ſin at ſuch a time as this, when <hi>God hath taken his Rod into his hand,</hi> and ſuch a Red as now he hath, can be no leſſe then a bidding of utter defiance to him.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151452:82"/> as indeed it is, for it is propoſed in a ſeeming Contradiction. Firſt the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes, that he is <hi>crucified with Chriſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeemes to ſay as much, as that he is not living, but dead. For Chriſt was crucified to Death. And then he ſayes, that he is <hi>nevertheleſſe alive,</hi> and thereby ſeemes to ſay, and ſayes it in more then ſeemes, that he is not dead, but living. Now thus to ſay it, and to unſay it, is to make a contradiction of it, at leaſt in ſeeme. It is to ſpeak a <hi>Paradox</hi> in it. And all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes are admirable Propoſitions,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Romane Oratour;</hi> And this Text for a Paradox is as admirable as any other. Every Riddle hath ſomething myſticall in it: But this Paradoxicall Riddle is a very myſtery.

                  <p>Our Saviours crucifixion, and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> concrucifixion were both myſterious, both full of Paradoxes; and <hi>our Saviours Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was as paradoxicall as his <hi>Paſſion.</hi> They are both the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of many and many ſeeming contradictions.

And hee was the onely Sonne of his Virgin Mother, and the Sonne onely of his Mother as hee was her Sonne, and borne of her; His Mother, did bear him without the office of a Father. On his Fathers ſide hee was God, and not Man, and on his Mothers ſide he was Man, and not God; yet betwixt both hee was both, God and Man, to mediate betwixt both, at his firſt comming, and to arbitrate betwixt both at his ſecond.</p>
                  <p>No wonder then it was, that <hi>his Name was called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> for every thing in him was full of Wonder, and his Paſſion was as wonderfull as any thing. His comming into the world had a world of wonder in it; and ſo had his being in it, and his leaving of it did leave as many behind it.</p>
                  <p>Hee was crucified, yet was not crucified; Hee ſuffered, yet did not ſuffer; Hee dyed, yet did not die; and hee roſe againe ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> yet did not riſe againe: And are not all theſe<note place="margin">S. <hi>Ambroſ. de Spirit. ſancto.</hi>

Two Natures were united in that one Perſon of Chriſt; And Chriſt endured that in one of his Natures which the other could not endure; As Man, or in his Manhood he ſuffered, was crucified, and dyed, and roſe from Death: But as God, or in his Deity, he could doe neither.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Life and Death of Chriſt were very myſterious, full of myſteries, and ſo are the Life and Death of every myſticall Member of Chriſt. Every true Chriſtian is ſuch a Member, and this <hi>Veſſell of Election,</hi> our holy Apoſtle, was ſuch a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.

                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> was in the ſtate of Nature, hee was both dead and alive, hee was alive Naturally, but dead ſpiritually. But when he changed the ſtate of Nature for the ſtate of Grace, he changed the Natures of his life and death. He was <hi>dead in ſinne</hi> before, but now <hi>dead unto ſinne,</hi> or ſinne is dead in him; Hee lived as a Naturall Man before, but now as a Spirituall; He lived in ſin before, but now Grace lives in him. Hee is now dead to himſelfe, dead to his ſinnes, but alive to his Saviour, living to the Lord of life; Crucified with Chriſt, and living to him, alive in him. Now this his myſticall death is very deſirable. It is rather to be wiſhed, then any kinde of Death, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> thought of. It is a Death that may be lawfully ſought for: yea, it is a Death that men muſt pull upon themſelves as ſoon as they can with a holy kinde of violence, and the more earneſt any man is in doing of it, the more he is to be praiſed for it; and more worthy of praiſe is hee, that thus <hi>killeth the old Man</hi> in himſelfe, then ever <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> was, or <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Lucretia,</hi> for<note place="margin">Plato <hi>in Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.

But our Apoſtle loſeth nothing, and gaineth all: He gets a new life without giving the old away. But his concrucifixion was of an other kinde, It was not corporal, but ſpiritual, and ſuch concrucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are twofold.</p>

                  <p>A Third thing that makes our Mortification difficult, is <hi>the Time that the Old Man</hi> in us muſt have to dye in. He muſt needs dye a lingring death, for he muſt be dying all the dayes of our Naturall life. Thoſe <hi>two Malefactours,</hi> that were crucified corporally when Chriſt was, had lingring Deaths; yea ſo long they were in dying, that the Souldiers had Orders given them to breake their legs, for the haſtening of their Deaths. And he that begins to crucifie the <hi>Old Man</hi> in himſelfe, ſhall finde him ſo loath to dye, and ſo long in dying, that new violences muſt be offered to him to make him yeeld. The faſtening of him to the Croſſe does make him ſick, and the breaking of his legs does make him weak: Yet will he not dye ſo long as the man does live, nor wholly yeeld to the <hi>spirituall man</hi> untill that ye yeelds up his ſpirit. The nature of this myſticall death does differ much from the death of Nature; this is <hi>mors ſine morte,</hi> a death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out death. That may be a lingring death ſometimes, but this is ever a living death, a death in life. It is <hi>Martyrium vivum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> phraſeth it, a living Martyrdome, a killing of the fleſh, and a leaving of the man alive. <hi>Martyrium ſine ſanguine,</hi>

Thus much the Apoſtle intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Romanes, in ſaying, <hi>As ye have yeelded your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to uncleanneſſe, and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even ſo now yeeld your members ſervants to righteouſneſſe, unto holineſſe, Rom.</hi> 6. 19.

This Morall Concrucifixion may conſiſt with Naturall Conſervation; This Mortification is not meant of the Common Death of Man, ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and<note place="margin">S. Chryſ.

And with this Mortification of the Old man there muſt ever be the Vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New man. <hi>I am Crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſſe I live.</hi> There is life with Death, yea life by it.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Naturall Man</hi> beginnes to live, then hee beginnes to die: and when the <hi>Spirituall Man</hi> beginnes to die, then hee begins to live. Mans <hi>firſt Birth</hi> leads him unto Death, His <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> lets him into Life. Hee is borne at firſt to die; But borne againe to live. It is the beginning of Miſery to be borne once; But the beginning of Felicity to be borne againe. The <hi>firſt Birth</hi> onely lets man into Naturall life, and into that but onely for a time, and that time but a ſhort one too; But the <hi>ſecond Birth</hi> does let life into Man, and that a Spirituall life, and that's the Pledge, and Meanes of life eternall. It is the Nature of mans firſt life to give him onely the life of Nature; But the <hi>ſecond</hi> life, being the life of Grace, does give the Grace of life. And this life of Grace is the only way unto the life of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to the Glory of that life.</p>
                  <p>But firſt a Man muſt be crucified, before he can be glorified; he muſt die before hee can live: and this his dying too muſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:151452:88"/> be before his death. Hee muſt be as the Apoſtle was, Dead and alive together, <hi>Crucified with Chriſt and yet alive.</hi> Dead and yet not dead; Not <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> and alive in Nature: But dead unto ſinne, and alive in Grace and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                     <hi>Peter</hi> that forſooke the World for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake; Not like to <hi>Demas</hi> that forſooke S. <hi>Paul</hi> to imbrace the preſent World. Like a dead man in the World, hee muſt not doate upon it; But live in it as if hee were departed from it. Hee muſt not be like that <hi>younger Widdow</hi> that our Apoſtle wrote a warning of unto young <hi>Timothy, that liveth in pleaſure, and is dead whilſt</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhe liveth;</hi> But like our holy Apoſtle himſelfe, that lived whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt hee was dead. Hee muſt dy unto ſinne before his Naturall<note place="margin">Climac. in ſcala Parad i.</note> Death, that hee may not dy in ſinne, when hee muſt needs dy a Naturall Death. If hee ſuffereth ſinne to live in him untill his Naturall Death, hee muſt ſuffer a Death Eternall for living ſo in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Mans <hi>firſt Birth</hi> brings him forth a <hi>Sinner,</hi> his <hi>ſecond</hi> brings him forth a <hi>Saint:</hi> By his <hi>firſt Birth</hi> hee is made what hee was not before his <hi>Generation;</hi> By his <hi>Second</hi> hee is made againe what hee was not by his <hi>First,</hi> and yet remaineth what hee was. His Generation made him a Man, His Regeneration makes him more, it makes him a good Man, a Man of <hi>God,</hi> a Member of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is that, that this Apoſtle intended of himſelfe in his ſtate of Regeneration, when hee ſaid that hee did live, and yet not he. I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſſe I live, yet not I. Now this may ſet our thoughts to the ſecond Generall of the Text, the Reading of the Riddle; but I muſt deale with you, as thoſe are wont to doe with others, that propoſe hard Riddles to them, I muſt give you a longer time to conſider of it, then meerely this time of your hearing of it; I muſt give you untill our meeting next in this place, which muſt, (God willing) be in the afternoone, then I ſhall give you the reading of this Riddle; but thus much for this Time.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>In the Fore-noone you heard the Riddle propounded, This After-noone you are to heare it expounded. The Riddle was propounded in theſe words, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I live.</hi> Now it is to be expounded by theſe words, <hi>yet not I, but Christ that liveth in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not I,</hi> but how doe theſe words Reſolve, or Reade the Riddle? They rather ſeeme to make an other Riddle, or to make the Text like the Prophets Myſticall Viſion of a Wheele within a Wheele. Here is one ſeeming contradiction upon an other, a Riddle upon a Riddle; for firſt hee ſayes, <hi>I live,</hi> and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:151452:90"/> then hee ſayes, <hi>not I,</hi> and ſo ſeemes to ſay, and unſay, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, had hee ſaid no more but <hi>yet not I,</hi> hee had not read the former, but made an other; But the clauſile added in the cloſe diſcloſeth all, <hi>not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me.</hi> This like a Key unlocks the Cabinet of the myſtery; This like an <hi>Oedipus</hi> unriddles all; Like a Clue it guides the Reader thorow the Labyrinth of the Riddle to the Reading of it. It ſhews what life it is, that now hee liveth; It ſpeakes the change of his life, from that of a Naturall man, to that of a Chriſtian; He liveth now the life of one that is in Chriſt, the Lord of life. The life of one that hath the Lord of life, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and the life of the Lord now in him, <hi>not I now, but Chriſt in me.</hi> Hee cannot now ſay with the Heatheniſh Poet, <hi>Ille ego qui quondam,</hi> I the ſame Man, that in time paſt did ſo and ſo, but with the convert, <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> I am not I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I live, yet not I,</hi> Not I the ſame, but I an other. An other, and yet I.

The ſame Man ſtill in Perſon hee is, and ſtill the ſame in Parts: But in Paſſions or Affections hee is now an other. The ſame hee is in conſtitution of Body, and in Quantity, but in quality of Minde, and in conditions hee is an other Man. A

                  <p>It was neither a <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> nor yet meerely a <hi>Morall life</hi> which the Apoſtle lived, but an <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> and this finiſhed his Ceremoniall, and furthered his Morall. By Chriſts living in him, he did not meane the Perſon of Chriſt, but his power in him. Chriſts living in us ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is his working in<note place="margin">S.

For the Goſpell does not utterly deſtroy the Morall law, nor make it abſolutely voyd. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the law or the Prophets; I came not to deſtroy, ſaith Chriſt, but to fulfill, Math. 5. 17.

Not<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> under the law to ſeeke for juſtification by it, but yet they are under it to encreaſe their ſanctification by it. They are not under the Curſe of the law to Condemnation, but under the Courſe of the law they are for Commendation. Not under the Rigor of it, but under the Rule of it. And he can never be a true diſciple of Chriſt that will not be ruled by it.</p>
                  <p>He that would live with Chriſt in Heaven, muſt live with him on Earth firſt. He that would be like him in the life of Glory, muſt be like alſo in the life of Grace. And he that would be ſo, muſt labour to be like him in his Moralls. He that is Crucified with Chriſt, muſt live like one that is ſo Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151452:92"/> like one that is <hi>dead to ſinne,</hi> like one that is dead unto himſelfe, like one that hath Chriſt living in him, and that can never be, untill the life of Chriſt be repreſented in his life, in the manner, or morality of it. It is this that our Apoſtle<note place="margin">S. Auguſt. Serm. 13. de verb. Dom.</note> cheifely points at in the Text, when he ſayes Chriſt liveth in him. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>numquodque ſecundùm hoc vivat, unde vivit,</hi> Saith Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> every thing ought to live according to that by which it liveth. The Body liveth of the Soule; And the Soule liveth of Chriſt: Let both then live according to thoſe things that give them life; let the Body live ſo after the Soule, and the Soule ſo after Chriſt, that both ſoule and body may live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Chriſt for ever hereafter.</p>
                  <p>It is from this kinde of life, that a man may have hope in death. And it is by this kinde of life that a man may aſſure himſelfe that he is dead. Death unto ſinne is beſt atteſted by the life of Grace. It was by this that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine himſelfe of his concrucifixion. By this it was that he knew himſelfe to be a Mortified member of the myſticall body of Chriſt. He found Chriſt living in him, and that made him ſay, that he was crucified with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is no eaſie matter for a man to be as this <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was, a Mortified Man, <hi>Crucified with Chriſt;</hi> But eaſie it is for a Man to know he is ſo, if he be ſo; yet many are miſtaken in this matter, and take themſelves to be ſo when they are not; but the reaſon is, they doe not obſerve the Manners of a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crucified. They doe not obſerve how it was with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he was crucified, or with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was crucified with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> They doe not enquire whether it be ſo with themſelves.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt was crucified he was <hi>Patient,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſal. 53. 7.</note> in all his ſufferings for Chriſt, when he was concrucified. Are all we ſo? Are we <hi>patient in tribulations?</hi> Can we ſuffer our<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> loſſes, and croſſes with patience? <hi>When our Saviour was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he revlied not againe.
